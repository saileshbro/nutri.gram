description: >
  Nutrition is the main source of life and although it has been our secondary
  instinct to check for nutritional value in the food we eat, the effect any
  diet has on our body and health is consequential. From the fact which connotes
  the value of nutrition in our diet, springs the idea of nutri.gram. nutri.gram
  is a mobile application that scans the food label present in the packaged food
  items and draws significant conclusions from that data regarding its edibleness
  for a person, the nutritional worth it adds to our diet, how much calorific value
  it provides per serving, and much more.
